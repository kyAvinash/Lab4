# Steps to Compile and Run

1. Create the Java Files:
   - Save the content into their respective files: `Node.java`, `BestFirstSearch.java`, `Main.java`, and `TreeVisualization.java`.

2. Compile the Java Files:
   - Open Command Prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the Java files using the `cd` command.
     ```cmd
     cd C:\JavaProjects\BestFirstSearch
     ```

3. Compile the Java Files:
   - Use the `javac` command to compile the Java files.
     ```cmd
     javac Node.java BestFirstSearch.java Main.java TreeVisualization.java
     ```

4. Run the Java Program:
   - After successful compilation, run the `Main` class using the `java` command.
     ```cmd
     java Main
     ```

This will create a graphical representation of the tree structure showing the nodes and their connections. The tree visualization will open in a new window, providing a clear view of the Best-First Search algorithm's process and result.
